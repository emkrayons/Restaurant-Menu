    <h1>Delicious Bites Menu</h1>

    <h2>Appetizers</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>

          Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with balsamic glaze.
        </p>
      </li>

      <!-- Add two more appetizer items with descriptions -->
      <li>
        <strong>Cocktails</strong>

        <p>
          Cocktail sauce usually contains ingredients like ketchup, horseradish,
          fruit juice like lemons, and Worcestershire sauce.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Soup</strong>

        <p>
          These warm dishes can make for quality meals and, due to the varied
          serving sizes, serve as perfect appetizers too. Also, being that soups
          are liquids, they don’t fill people up the way other foods do.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Main Courses</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong>

        <p>
          Salmon fillet seasoned and grilled to perfection, served with lemon
          butter sauce.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cedar-Plank Salmon</strong>

        <p>
          A big salmon fillet always feels like a festive main course,
          especially when it's cooked on a cedar grilling plank, so it picks up
          a whisper of smoky flavor. Kick off your seafood-themed dinner party
          with grilled oysters and pair the fish with a simple tomato salad.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Grilled Pizza</strong>

        <p>
          Grilling pizza makes a main dish recipe into a party. This dough is
          designed for the grill—you can get creative with your toppings, or let
          your guests go wild.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desserts</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>

        <p>
          Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cakes</strong>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most popular dessert of all time, cake contains a
          combination of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, leavening agents
          (such as yeast or baking powder), and sometimes milk or water. It’s
          topped with sweet and creamy icing for the ultimate treat.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cookies</strong>

        <p>
          Made from flour and sugar, cookies are usually small, flat, and round.
          To create sandwich cookies, just place a small amount of jam or icing
          in the middle of two cookies. Cookies can also be cut in elaborate
          shapes, perfect for different seasons and events.
